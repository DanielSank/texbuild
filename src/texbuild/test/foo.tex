\section{Foo}

This is section foo.
We have some labeled stuff like this neat equation
\begin{equation}
  \exp(i x) = \cos(x) + i \sin(x)  \label{euler}
  \, .
\end{equation}
It's not exported, but we can still refer to it as Eq.~\ref{euler}.
Here's another labeled equation
\begin{equation}
  \int_{\partial M} X = \int_M dX  \label{stokes}  % export
\end{equation}
which is exported.
We can still refer to it, like this: Eq.~\ref{stokes}.

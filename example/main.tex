\maketitle

This document illustrates the use of \texttt{texbuild}, a build system for \LaTeX{} documents.
We're going to label three different equations in three different files all with the same label, and we'll still be able to refer to each one.

First, we label an equation as ``\texttt{equation}'' in the main document
% The "% export" here makes the labeled item importable into other files.
\begin{equation}
  \ln(\exp(x)) = x \label{equation} % export
\end{equation}
and refer to it, i.e. as Equation~(\ref{equation}).

In a moment, we're going to include two sub-files, \texttt{SeaCreatures/sea\_creatures.tex} and \texttt{LandCreatures/land\_creatures.tex}, each of which has an equation with label ``\texttt{equation}''.
Normally, this would be a problem, as the namespace for labeled items in \LaTeX{} is global and no two items can have the same label.
However, through the power of \texttt{texbuild}, we can refer to them via namespaces.
Behold: the equation in \texttt{SeaCreatures/sea\_creatures.tex} is Equation~(\ref{sc.equation}) and the equation in \texttt{LandCreatures/land\_creatures.tex} is Equation~(\ref{lc.equation}).
We can refer to the figure too, i.e. as Figure~(\ref{sc.figure}).
Now let's actually include those files.
